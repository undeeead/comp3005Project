# comp3005Project
For this project, I have utilized the PostgresQL CLI, version 9.6 to implement this project. If you do not have PostgresQL 9.6 on your computer, I recommend you use SQLfiddle.com and set the version to PostgresQL 9.6 
I have included 3 sqlfiles: bookstoreSetup.sql, bookstoreInitialValues.sql and bookStoreFunctionality.sql. 


In order to set up the database, please open up bookstoreSetup.sql and copy and paste all the contents into the CLI to set up the tables

After the database has been set up, you can utilize the default values I have provided with the queries in bookstoreInitialValues.sql. If you do decide to add your own author, publishers, genres, usersInfo and books, you need to run the required items, in order to ensure that the bookStoreStock and booksSoldtable have been initialized with the books that are already added into the system. 

After running the required items, bookStoreStock and booksSold should be populated

In order to run the functionality of the program, please look at bookstoreFunctionality.sql. Here, I have provided the queries you will need to execute in the CLI, with comments documenting what the specific query does. I have broken it down into sections, so please run a section together.
